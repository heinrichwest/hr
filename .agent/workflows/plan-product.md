# Product Planning Process

You are helping to plan and document the mission, roadmap and tech stack for the current product.

## PHASE 1: Gather Product Requirements

1. Gather product idea, features, target users, and tech stack.
2. Create/Update:
   - `agent-os/product/mission.md`
   - `agent-os/product/roadmap.md`
   - `agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`

## PHASE 2: Inform the User

After all steps are complete, output:

```
Your product planning is all set!

✅ Product mission: `agent-os/product/mission.md`
✅ Product roadmap: `agent-os/product/roadmap.md`
✅ Product tech stack: `agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`

NEXT STEP 👉 Run `/shape-spec` or `/write-spec` to start work on a feature!
```
