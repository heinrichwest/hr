# Spec Writing Process

You are creating a comprehensive specification for a new feature.

1. Find the current spec folder or the most recent in `agent-os/specs/*/`.
2. Read the requirements from `planning/requirements.md`.
3. Analyze any visual assets in `planning/visuals/`.
4. Create `spec.md` inside the spec folder.
5. Once `spec.md` is created, output the following to inform the user:

```
Your spec.md is ready!

✅ Spec document created: `[spec-path]`

NEXT STEP 👉 Run `/create-tasks` to generate your tasks list for this spec.
```
